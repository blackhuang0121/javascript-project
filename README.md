# JavaScript Projects

A collection of small JavaScript demos. Each project lives in its own folder:

- `attack-on-titan/`
- `image-slider/`
- `stranger-things/`

The root `index.html` lists all available demos. Open this file in your browser to browse the projects.

## Running a single project

Navigate to the project directory and open its `index.html` directly in a browser:

- `attack-on-titan/index.html`
- `image-slider/index.html`
- `stranger-things/index.html`
